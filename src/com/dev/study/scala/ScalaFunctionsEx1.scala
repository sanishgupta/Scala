/**
 * Scala has both functions and methods and we use the terms method
 *  and function interchangeably with a minor difference
 *
 * A Scala method is a part of a class which has a name, a signature, optionally some 
 * annotations, and some bytecode
 *
 * where as a function in Scala is a complete object which can be assigned to a variable.
 * In other words, a function, which is defined as a member of some object, is called a method.
 *
 * A function definition can appear anywhere in a source file and Scala permits nested 
 * function definitions, that is, function definitions inside other function definitions.
 * Most important point to note is that Scala function's name can have characters 
 * like +, ++, ~, &,-, --, \, /, :, etc.
